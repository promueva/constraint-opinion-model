# Constraint Opinion Models

Constraint Opinion Models extend the standard DeGroot model by representing
agents' opinions and influences as soft constraints rather than single real
values. This allows for modeling scenarios beyond the scope of the DeGroot
model, such as agents sharing partial information and preferences, engaging in
discussions on multiple topics simultaneously, and representing opinions with
different degrees of uncertainty. By considering soft constraints as
influences, the proposed model captures also situations where agents impose
conditions on how others' opinions are integrated during belief revision.
Constraint Opinion Models are equipped with a polarization measure that
determines the distance between opinions. 

This repository contains a proof of concept for experimenting with Constraint
Opinion Models. 

## Getting Stated
The scripts were tested with [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/). Some
dependencies are needed that can be installed with pip (see file
`requirements.txt`).
